## Framework
This app will show the information of your country in terms of total cases, suspected cases, confirmed cases, deaths and recovered, this will help you to have an idea how the pandemic is in your country. I am using [Corona Lmao Ninja](https://corona.lmao.ninja/v2/countries) to get all this information.
